Modular Diary tool, easy to integrate with websites

## Integrating the tool

Follow these steps to integrate the Diary Tool into your website:

1. Clone the `diary.html` file, `css/`, `js/`, and `build/` folders into your website's directory.
2. Create a copy of your spreadsheet containing quotes for the diary and testimony. Follow the instructions in the [Creating your own spreadsheet](README.md#creating-your-own-spreadsheet) section of this README.
3. Replace the links in the `script.js` file with the links to your newly created spreadsheets. The `script.js` file can be found in the `js/` directory.
4. Link the `diary.html` file from your website. You can do this by adding a link to `diary.html` in your website's navigation menu or wherever you find it appropriate.
5. Ensure that the stylesheets and scripts are correctly linked in your HTML files. The `diary.html` file should have links to the CSS files in the `css/` and `build/css/` directories, and to the JavaScript file in the `js/` directory.

That's it! You have successfully integrated the Diary Tool into your website.
